<H1 ALIGN =CENTER> Create Rectangle Structure with Length and Breadth and Add Method to Calculate Area </H1>  

## AIM:  
To create a structure with length and breadth values and calculate the area of a rectangle.  

## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:  
- Hardware – PCs  
- Software – Visual Studio Code (Version 1.104.0)  
- Rust Installation  

## RELATED THEORETICAL CONCEPT:  

*Structures in Rust:*  
A structure (struct) in Rust is a custom data type that lets you group related values together. Each field in a struct can have a different type.  

*Methods in Rust:*  
Methods are functions defined within the context of a struct, enum, or trait object. They are used to implement behavior associated with that data type.  

*Need for Structs with Methods:*  
- Encapsulates related data into one unit.  
- Improves code reusability and readability.  
- Allows defining behavior (like area calculation) directly associated with the struct.  

## ALGORITHM:  
STEP 1: Create a structure **Rectangle** with numeric fields `length` and `breadth`. <BR>  
STEP 2: Implement an `area` method for the `Rectangle` structure. <BR>  
STEP 3: In the `main` function, define a structure variable and assign values for length and breadth. <BR>  
STEP 4: Call the `area` method and print the calculated value of area of the rectangle. <BR>
